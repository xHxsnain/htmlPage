						<b>4.7.1.1 Internal hardware components of a computer:</b>
							<br>Internal Components Understanding the internal components of the processor is fundamental to understanding the Stored Program Concept.<br> It is important to know that the internal components work together to make the machine work just like car parts work together to make a car work.<br> By itself, a spark plug does nothing.  Put it into an engine and it has a purpose as part of the whole process. Similarly, each component in the processor<br> is dependent on the other components to function to make the processor work.
					</ul>

						<b>4.7.2.1 The meaning of the stored program concept:</b>
						<br>The Stored Program Concept
						<br>This is as it is written here, and you need to learn and understand this definition:
						<br>"Machine code instructions stored in the main memory are fetched and executed serially by a processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations"
						<br>What has been described here is the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle.
					</ul>
					<b><ul>Rational numbers:<br></b>Rational numbers are the set of all numbers that can be expressed as fraction.</ul>
					<b><ul>Irrational numbers:<br></b>Irrational numbers are the set of all numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction.</ul>
					<b><ul>Real numbers:<br></b>Real numbers are the set of all numbers that are what we call "real world quantities".<br>They include natural numbers, integers, the rational numbers and the irrational numbers.  </ul>
					<b><ul>Ordinal numbers:<br></b>Ordinal numbers tell the position of an object in a set of objects.<br>For example, this can be an index for an array.</ul>
					<b><ul>Counting and measurement:<br></b>We use natural numbers for counting. We use real numbers for measurement.</ul>
					<b><ul>Fixed Point Binary Numbers:<br></b>Fixed-point binary numbers represent real numbers with a fixed position for the binary point.</ul>
					<b><ul>Floating Point Binary Numbers:</b>Floating-point binary numbers are a method of representing real numbers in binary format, <br> allowing for a dynamic positioning of the binary point to accommodate a wide range of values and varying levels of precision.</ul>
